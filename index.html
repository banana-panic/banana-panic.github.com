<h1>UA Campus Tour App</h1>
<p>
Banana Panic is a group of students at the University of Alabama formed with the intention
of building a UA Campus Tour app for the Android smartphone platform.
</p>
<p>
In short, our application will be a guide for prospective students and their parents while they
walk across campus. The app will also provide vistors with background information about landmarks
and points of interest as they come across them on campus.
</p>
<h1>Importance</h1>
<p>
It is our experience that campus tours are of great importance in helping prospective students
make informed decisions about where to matriculate, as well as strongly influencing the decisions
of potential future staff members. While campus tours are available prospective students at
regularly-scheduled intervals, we believe that the current system is too limiting. It leaves out
students who cannot fit these tours into their schedules. It may also exclude staff members (who
may be interested in tour-type information, but embarrased to attend a new-student tour).
</p>
<p>
Our app will also open the door to completely new discovery experiences. It will make it
possible to have a tour-like experience from the comfort of one's own home. It will also feature a
passive discovery mode, allowing vistors to walk around campus on their own route, while still
providing interesting information as they approach points of interest. Finally, we expect to allow
focused sub-tours in fine-grained areas that it would not be practical to have a dedicated tour guide for.
</p>
<h1>Goal Functionality</h1>
<p>Our goal is to create an application that will guide visitors through a series of
points-of-interest, allowing them to explor the campus as they go. In its primary mode, our app
would display a map that would show a user both their current location and the direction of the
next stop on their tour. Once they proceded far enough in the proper direction, a point would come
into view on the map, allowing them to go to exactly the right place. They would then be presented
some combination of text, images, and video that would inform them about the significance of the
landmark. We also intend to offer spech-to-text functionality in order to facilitate the sharing of
a single Android device among small to medium sized groups.</p>
<p>As secondary features, we hope to add some important abilities, which have already been touched
on. First, we hope to implement a "discovery mode", which allows for a less guided experience. The
interface would still display a map with the user's location, but the user would not be given a
specific destination. Instead, all points-of-interest would be highlighted on the map. The user
would be encouraged to explore campus by their own route and would have access to the information
about any building that they approached. It would also support pulling up information about an
arbitrary building that the user was not close to (to facilitate off-campus viewing). Second, we
will implement a filtering system, which would allow a user to take a tour more suited to their
specific areas of interest. For example, a prospective computer science student, may want to take
the "CS tour".</p>
<p>If time allows, intent to develop our application into a general framework for that would allow
any school to implement a similar app in a greatly reduced timeframe. In an ideal world, we would
build a desktop application that could read a domain-specific langauge (or just xml) and a set of
resource files and generate a compiled Android APK (application package). The specifics of this
framework are still being fleshed out, so it could take a very different, much-reduced form.</p>
<h1>Android Benefits</h1>
<p>
We think that the Android platform offers the ideal environment for our application due to the
combination of its open-source, freely-available nature and its powerful APIs. We intend to use
Android's location API extensively to determine when participants have reached trigger locations
during their tour. giving information about a building as the user arrives at the location. We also
plan to take advantage of Android&#39s readily-available text-to-speech functionality to read
information aloud for the user. Finally, our idea of using a desktop app to turn our code into a
framework for other apps simply wouldn't work on other platforms, where "app factories" are firmly
rejected.
