<p>Hello, welcome to Banana Panic</p>
<p>We&#39re working on a project at the University of Alabama called the UA Campus Tour App.</p>
<p>On a very basic level the application is a guide for prospective students and parents to walk a
person across campus and give a little background information about each point of interest they
come across it.</p>
<p>We think a campus tour is important to any university for the purpose of recruiting students,
faculty, and staff. While campus tours are usually offered to incoming freshmen, we want to
make an application that is accessible to anyone with an android smartphone.</p>
<p>Having an application available on the market is more convenient that having to meet with a tour
guide...dependent on their availability. With our app you can tour the campus at anytime, even
from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>The premise is to have an application that can take you from building to building, exploring
the campus as you go. If time and resources allow, we would like to develop a framework
allowing other campus&#39s to build their own tour by simply adding their own building locations
and informational tidbits or videos. In addition to the guided tour, we&#39d also like to include
functionality to tell the user where they are and explain what the building they are looking at is
commonly used for.</p>
<p>We think the android platform is ideal for the application due to it&#39s open source nature. We
intend to use the Global Positioning System and Location Based Services extensively to trigger
the tour, giving information about a building as the user arrives at the location. We also plan
to take advantage of Android&#39s Text-to-speech function to read a location&#39s tidbit aloud for the
user... giving the experience of having a personal tour guide and allowing a group to tour with a
single phone.</p>
<p>If you&#39ve got any suggestions, please <a href="about.html">drop us a line</a></p>
